# Welcome to ***MetaIQ*** ! #

MetaIQ is a collection of computational methods for **Meta**bolite **I**dentification and **Q**uantification

One of the main codes currently available via MetaIQ is Pactolus. The goal of Pactolus is to enable the large-scale application of database searching for metabolite identification by overcoming core computational challenge and improving accuracy as well as to provide a foundation for the community to develop new scoring approached in an efficient manner. 

### Origins of the name Pactolus ###

The original development of Pactolus was inspired by MIDAS (see [http://midas-omicsbio.ornl.gov/](http://midas-omicsbio.ornl.gov/), a database searching approach for metabolite identification in metabolomics based on the matching of measured tandem mass spectra against the predicted fragments of metabolites in a database. In Greek mythology, King Midas is popularly remembered for his ability to turn everything he touched into gold. According to legend, [King Midas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas) divested himself of the golden touch by washing himself in the river [Pactolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pactolus). After King Midas washed himself in the river Pactolus, the power of the golden touch flowed into the river, and the sands of the river turned into gold. 

### How do I get set up? ###

Pactolus is written in pure python. The main dependencies of Pactolus are h5py, numpy, scipy, and optionally mpi4py.
